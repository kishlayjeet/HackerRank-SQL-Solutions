## Introduction

[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) is a popular online platform that offers coding challenges and programming competitions. This repository contains my solutions to a wide range of SQL problems from HackerRank.

By sharing my solutions, I aim to provide a helpful resource for those looking to learn or improve their SQL querying skills. However, I encourage you to try solving the problems on your own before consulting the solutions.

## Problem Categories

The solutions in this repository are categorized according to the problem types on HackerRank. The following categories are included:

- **Basic Select**: Problems involving basic SQL queries to retrieve data from a single table.
- **Advanced Select**: Problems that require more complex SQL queries, including joins and subqueries.
- **Aggregation**: Problems related to aggregate functions, grouping, and summarizing data.
- **Basic Join**: Problems that involve joining multiple tables based on specific conditions.
- **Advanced Join**: Problems requiring advanced join techniques, such as self-joins and correlated subqueries.
- **Alternative Queries**: Problems that explore alternative ways to achieve the desired results using SQL.

Each category has its own folder, and within each folder, you will find the problem statement and its corresponding solution file(s).
